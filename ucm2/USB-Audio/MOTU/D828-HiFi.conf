#MOTU 828 (28x32) Factory Defaults
#This is how the MOTU 828 initially appears in its included CueMix5 software for Mac OSX and Windows

#All devices are stereo
#except for the two front microphone ports (each mono)
#and the two rear optical ports (each is 8-channel ADAT)

#***** Still needs to be done*****:
#1)  ADAT mode for banks A & B of optical ports (each bank has in + out, 8-channels).  I have removed these ports for now, as the macro only supports 2 channel parameters
#2)  Related to the above:  a conflict switch so that optical Bank A can switch between 2-channel TOSLink and 8-channel ADAT
#3)  Conflict switch for front microphones, to switch between 2 mono microphones or a single stereo microphone
#4)  Surround mapping (7.1 configuration, such that channels 0,1,4,5,6,7,8,9 map to FL,FR,FC,LFE,SL,SR,RL,RR (respectively)
#5)  Surround mixdown, such that line outs play surround, while headphones mixdown surround to stereo
